def treeGet(following, what, defaultAnswer=None):
    '''
    This function helps to navigate structures of lists and dictionaries with the same functionality of the get method of a dictionary without having to string a series of objects together.
    
    Short Example based on myTree below:
        classic python: 
            myTree.get('list',[None,{}])[1].get('test','unknown')
        treeGet python
            treeGet(myTree,'list[1].test','unknown')
            
        In the classic case, the default for list must contain a default answer capable of getting to the suceeding get (which means a dict). If we had been exploring element 10 the default answer would have been more complicated
    
    Example - Given an object structured as follows:
        myTree = {
            'dict': {
                'one': 1,
                'two': '2',
                'three': False
                },
                'list': [
                    'a',
                    { 'test': 'answer'},
                    3
                ],
                'string': 'test'
        }
        
        accessing test to retrieve answer would look something like the following.
            a = myTree.get('dict',{}).get('list',[None,None])[1].get('test','defaultanswer')
            
        Depending on how many items were expected in the "list" the default answer of [None,None] would have to be expanded to prevent the following [1] from failing. Also typically people would wrap this with a try/except to catch any unexpected failures
        
            try:
                a = myTree.get('dict',{}).get('list',[None,None])[1].get('test','defaultanswer')
            except:
                a = 'defaultanswer'
            
        This function provides all of the above as well as cloning each of the items as the tree is traversed so the return object is mutable and un-tied from the object from which it originated
    
            a = utils.treeGet(myTree, 'dict.list[1].test', 'defaultanswer')
